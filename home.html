                <h2 class = "aboutq"><span class="auto-type"></span></h2>
                <p class = "academic1">My name is Edward Shim, and I am currently a senior at the University of Pennsylvania 
                    majoring in Cognitive Science with a concentration in Computation & Cognition 
                    (College of Arts and Sciences) and minoring in Consumer Psychology 
                    (CAS and Wharton School of Business). Through my major and minor, I have obtained quantitative 
                    and qualitative skills.</h3>
                <p class = "academic2"> I am passionate about learning the relationship among human cognitive abilities, 
                    computational abilities, and consumer behaviors. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of my major, 
                    I have taken courses in computer science, psychology, marketing, statistics, and linguistics to 
                    understand the connections more thoroughly. In high school, I have also written and published 
                    research projects titled "Game Theory Analysis of the Proof of Work Consensus Algorithm" and 
                    "A Multiple Linear Regression Analysis of Virginia Schools to Predict Dropout Rates" to dig 
                    deeper into the art of cryptography and artificial intelligence. Since high school, my passion 
                    has shifted toward analyzing the art of computation and the human mind, which I hope to apply 
                    in the financial, consulting, and entrepreneurship industries.</p>
                <p class = "hobbies">Outside of academics, I love anything related to poker, soccer, and cooking. 
                    I started to play poker in college, and I instantly fell in love with the math and thrill behind 
                    the game. When it comes to soccer, I have watched, played, and analyzed it my whole life. 
                    My favorite team is FC Barcelona, with my two favorite players being Neymar Jr. and Messi. 
                    The art of dribbling, passing, and shooting of these two players has entranced me since I was a 
                    child. I have also played and captained my varsity lacrosse team in high school, in which my 
                    footwork from soccer came in handy. Cooking quickly became my hobby in high school, as I love 
                    food. I have taught myself how to cook multiple cuisines by watching YouTube videos and my 
                    mother's cooking. I would cook for my family, friends, and myself whenever possible. 
                    I learned to cook cuisines like Korean, Japanese, Chinese, English, French, Italian, American, 
                    and more through the basic cooking skills I have obtained over time. When I am not doing any work, 
                    you can find me doing something related to soccer, poker, or cooking.</p>
