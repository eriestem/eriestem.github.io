                <h2 class = "aboutq"><span class="auto-type"></span></h2>
                <p class = "academic1">My name is Edward Shim, and I am currently a senior at 
                    the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in Cognitive Science with a concentration 
                    in Computation & Cognition (College of Arts and Sciences) and minoring in Consumer Psychology 
                    (CAS and Wharton School of Business). My studies have equipped me with both quantitative and 
                    qualitative skills.</p>
                <p class = "academic2"> I am passionate about exploring the relationship between human cognitive 
                    abilities, computational skills, and consumer behaviors. My interdisciplinary major has allowed 
                    me to take courses in computer science, psychology, marketing, statistics, and linguistics, 
                    providing a comprehensive understanding of these interconnected fields. In high school, 
                    I published research projects titled "Game Theory Analysis of the Proof of Work Consensus Algorithm" 
                    and "A Multiple Linear Regression Analysis of Virginia Schools to Predict Dropout Rates," which 
                    delved into cryptography and artificial intelligence. Since then, my interests have evolved towards 
                    analyzing computation and the human mind, aiming to apply these insights in the financial, 
                    consulting, and entrepreneurial sectors.</p>
                <p class = "hobbies">Outside of academics, I am an avid fan of poker, soccer, gaming, and cooking. 
                    I started playing poker in college, captivated by the math and thrill of the game. I have 
                    been a lifelong soccer enthusiast, playing, watching, and analyzing the sport, with FC Barcelona 
                    and players like Neymar Jr. and Messi being my favorites. Their mastery in dribbling, passing, and 
                    shooting has fascinated me since childhood. I also captained my varsity lacrosse team in high school, 
                    where my soccer skills proved beneficial. I also love playing video games, especially Fifa, Fortnite, and 
                    Mario Kart, as I would play them often with on my XBOX and Nintendo Switch.
                    Cooking became a hobby during high school, inspired by my mother’s dishes and Gordon Ramsay. I enjoy 
                    preparing a wide range of cuisines, including Korean, Japanese, Chinese, English, French, Italian, 
                    and American. When not engaged with work, you’ll likely find me involved in activities related to soccer, poker, gaming, or cooking.</p>
