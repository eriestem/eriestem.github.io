                    I am passionate about exploring the relationships among human cognitive abilities, 
                    computational skills, and consumer behaviors. My interdisciplinary major at the 
                    University of Pennsylvania, where I study Cognitive Science with a concentration in 
                    Computation & Cognition, has allowed me to delve deeply into these areas through 
                    coursework in computer science, psychology, marketing, statistics, and linguistics.
                </p>
                <p class = "educabio1">
                    During my high school years, I authored and published two significant research projects: 
                    "Game Theory Analysis of the Proof of Work Consensus Algorithm" and "A Multiple Linear Regression 
                    Analysis of Virginia Schools to Predict Dropout Rates." These studies helped me deepen my understanding 
                    of cryptography and artificial intelligence. In college, I have worked at KPMG Korea as a 
                    financial data analytics and audit assistance intern to gain industrial experience in data analysis and 
                    financial literacy. 
                </p>
                <p class = "educabio2">
                    Since then, my focus has shifted toward analyzing computation and the human mind 
                    through advanced data analysis and research methods, skills I have actively applied 
                    in industry experiences. Looking forward, I aim to leverage this expertise further 
                    in the fields of finance, consulting, and entrepreneurship.
